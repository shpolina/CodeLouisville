1. Download Demo materials from https://github.com/shpolina/CodeLouisville
2. Open IntermediateDemo project in Intermediate folder

Part 1
3. Add Perimeter() method declaration to IShape interface
	What type should this method return?
4. Open RectangleExample2 class. Note that there is now an error in this file - IShape has a red squiggly line under it.
	Can you answer why?
5. Implement Perimeter() method in RectangleExample2 class
6. Compile and run your project. Print results in Main() to make sure everything works as expected

Part 2
7. Create new class Circle with property Radius of type double
8. Circle Is-A Shape, so let's make it inherit from IShape
9. Implement all required methods in Circle (just like we did for RectangleExample2)
10. Compile and run your project. Print results in Main() to make sure everything works as expected 

Reference:
	Rectangle is defined by Height and Wight, Circle is defined by Radius.
	To calculate Rectangle Perimeter use: 2*Heigth + 2*Widgth
	To calculate Circle Area use: 3.14*Radius ^ 2
	To calculate Circle Perimeter use: 2*3.14 * Radius
	C# has a method to calcualte a number raise to a power: Math.Pow(double number, double power), hence to calculate Radius^2 use Math.Pow(Radius, 2)
